# Accordee Frontend
This React frontend is part of my first proper web devleopment project. Most of the code as well as this readme was AI generated, and thus not very good. I will be working on a refactored version for my next project and sharing this one for archival purposes. If I have time later I will update this to remove the cloud infrastructure related functions such as the google bucket connection to make it easier to run locally. 

For now the main demo site should be viewable at https://accord.ee .
